                <p class="body-text">
                    The header is the uppermost part of a website. It’s often the first thing that visitors see when
                    they
                    enter a site and almost always contains the brand’s logo as well as the website menu. This website
                    menu
                    is the map of the site that helps visitors find what they’re looking for, whether it’s details about
                    your product or information about your company.

                    Typical headers include your most essential web pages, which may vary depending on the type of
                    website
                    you’re creating. If you have an online store, for instance, you might divide your header into
                    categories
                    based on the types of items that you sell. On the other hand, if you have a nonprofit website, a
                    donation page in the header would likely be more appropriate. Put bluntly, including the proper
                    categories in the header is essential in helping visitors find your most important pages and can
                    ultimately make the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful website.

                    These are the links at the top of the page to help you find what you’re looking for. The navigation
                    links are usually in the header or just below it.

                    When a site is viewed on a mobile device, the navigation usually morphs into an icon with 3 stacked
                    lines (aka a “hamburger” because it looks like the side view of a hamburger) since space is limited
                    on a mobile device. Tapping the mobile navigation icon usually triggers a vertical or horizontal
                    toggle menu.

                <p class="body-text">
                    Immediately below the header is some form of image, series of images or sometimes a video. Together,
                    the header and main image comprise the top section of your website - often referred to as above the
                    fold - and are essential in creating a good first impression. The featured visual, in particular,
                    makes a marked difference in whether users stay on your website or abandon seconds after entering.

                    With that in mind, this visual should convey something important about your company. Whether it
                    features images of your products or services, or just gives the user a feel of what your brand is
                    about, it is important that it relates to your site as a whole. We suggest choosing your best images
                    or browsing the images and videos available through Wix to give your website a professional edge.

                    In website development, the body of a website is a foundational component, whether a website is a
                    one-page site or if the website is a massive online forum or community that is updated in real-time.
                    If you are building a personal portfolio website, an ecommerce website, or even a site to represent
                    your business, your website's layout will require a body section to load and display content.

            <div class="column">
                <p class="title">Content</p>

                <p class="body-text">
                    All sites contain content. Content typically means the words written on your site that explain what
                    your website is about, what you have to offer and how site visitors can take advantage of your
                    offerings.

                    Website content covers a wide array of things. It often refers to the paragraphs that explain your
                    site’s mission, but it can also mean the one word that is placed on your buttons.


                    While short content on buttons or menus may seem insignificant, it is actually the driving force of
                    sites. This is the content that makes it clear what site visitors should expect when they click,
                    such as “Buy now” or “Shopping cart”. Take the time to carefully plan out your website content to
                    ensure that any site visitor can understand your brand as well as you do.

            <div class="column">
                <p class="title">Footer</p>

                <p class="body-text">
                    Simply put, a footer is the bottom most part of any site. It usually contains a sitemap with links
                    to the pages available on your site. This can help visitors find all of your offerings, including
                    those that may not have made the cut for your header.


                    Often website footers also contain basic contact information, enabling users to reach out to you or
                    find your physical storefront. This type of information is crucial for business success.


                    Footers also might include a social bar that contains small but recognizable icons that lead users
                    to your social media pages. This can help you gain followers on social media platforms, ultimately
                    bringing about greater brand awareness and potential business growth.
